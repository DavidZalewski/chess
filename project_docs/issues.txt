Queen and Bishop are throwing invalid move when the move is valid for a full board

ie. Move BP4 D6, BQ1 should be able to move to A5, and BB1 should be able to move to D7
 -- currently code says they cant
 
Bp3 on C4 square was somehow captured by Wp3 when it moved from C2 to C4 


There is a WK1 on F6, BP5 on E7, BP5 F6 should be a valid capture, but code says it is not

Moved BK2 from G8 to F6, to capture WK1 on F6, but it shows that WK1 is still on F6 and BK2 has disappeared 
from the board

The board is left in an invalid state
